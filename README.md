# üß¨ Predicting the Genetic Disorder
Capstone Project at UC Berkeley: PC-MLAI

**Author:** Mitali Bansal

**üîç Research Question:** How can we accurately predict the type and subclass of genetic disorders in children based on their medical information and family history?

## üéØ Executive summary
### Rationale
As per reports, as a consequence of the unsustainable increase in population and a lack of access to adequate health care, food, and shelter, the number of genetic disorder ailments have increased. Hereditary illnesses are becoming more common due to a lack of understanding about the need for genetic testing. Often kids die as a result of these illnesses, thus genetic testing during pregnancy is critical.

    - It is crucial to address these missing values through imputation or other suitable methods to ensure robust model training.
- **Data Types:**
    - The dataset includes both numerical (float64) and categorical (object) data types.
    - Conversion and encoding of categorical variables will be necessary for machine learning model training.
- **Initial Observations:**
    - The dataset provides comprehensive medical and genetic information which can be leveraged to predict genetic disorders.
    - The presence of symptoms, medical test results, and parental genetic information are likely to be key predictors for the target variables.
    - Handling missing values, identifying outliers, data cleaning, data balancing and feature engineering are critical preprocessing steps to ensure the effectiveness of the predictive models.

#### Potential Challenges
- **Complex Interactions:** Genetic factors can interact with environmental and other factors in complex ways.
- **Data Privacy:** Handling sensitive patient data requires appropriate privacy measures. Remove such columns.
- **Interpretability:** Understanding the reasons behind model predictions can be challenging due to the complexity of genetic data. 

By thoroughly understanding and preparing the data, we can build accurate and reliable models to predict genetic disorders and their subclasses, ultimately aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## üß∞ Data Preparation

The data preparation phase is crucial for ensuring that the dataset is clean, consistent, and suitable for model training. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and potentially feature engineering. Here are the detailed steps for data preparation:

### Data Cleaning:
- **Drop Irrelavent columns**
    - Remove columns that do not contribute to the prediction of genetic disorders, ensuring a more focused dataset.
    - Following columns are identified irrelavent: 'Patient Id', 'Patient First Name', 'Family Name', 'Father's name', 'Test 1', 'Test 2', 'Test 3', 'Test 5' (Test 1-3 and 5 have all values = 0)
- **Find and Remove Duplicates (if any)**: No Duplicates found.
- **Rename Columns**
  - Rename columns with appropriate short names for clarity and ease of use.

### üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the Data Exploration phase, conducted a thorough analysis to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset. 
Key activities included:

#### **Missing Values Analysis:** 
Most columns have a missing rate of around 9-10%, with a few columns having more substantial gaps.
- **Low Missing Values (1% - 10%)**: *Inherited from father* (1.39%), *Patient Age* (6.46%).
- **Moderate Missing Values (9% - 10%)**: Many columns, such as *Respiratory Rate*, *Heart Rate*, *Parental Consent*, *Gender*, *Birth Asphyxia*, *WBC Count*, and *Genetic Disorder*, have around 9-10% missing data.
- **High Missing Values (Above 10%)**: *Maternal gene* (12.72%), *Birth Defect* (19.89%).

#### **Bivariate Analysis:**

##### **Numerical vs. Numerical Correlation Summary:**
Scatter plots, correlation coefficients (like Pearson or Spearman), and regression analysis are used to assess relationships between two numerical variables.
- The correlation matrix shows how each feature in the dataset is related to the others.
- Most correlations are close to zero, indicating weak or no linear relationships between the variables.
- The strongest positive correlation is seen between Symptom 4 and Symptom 5 (0.0368)
- Patient Age has minimal correlations with other features.
- The NaN values for Test 4 suggest there was no data available for this feature, leading to undefined correlations.

##### **Categorical vs. Categorical Summary:** 
Contingency tables (cross-tabulation) and chi-square tests are used to examine associations between two categorical variables.

- **Summary of the chi-square test results for Genetic Disorder (p-value < 0.05):**
    1. **Inherited from mother**: Chi-Square = 203.93, p-value = 5.21e-45
    2. **Inherited from father**: Chi-Square = 196.11, p-value = 2.60e-43
    3. **Maternal gene**: Chi-Square = 116.83, p-value = 4.28e-26
    4. **Paternal gene**: Chi-Square = 115.47, p-value = 8.43e-26
    5. **Blood test result**: Chi-Square = 16.69, p-value = 0.01
    
    These features show a significant relationship with **Genetic Disorder**, suggesting they are important in explaining or predicting the target variable.

- **No Significant Association with Genetic Disorder (p-value >= 0.05):**
    - **Status**
    - **Respiratory Rate**
    - **Heart Rate**
    - **Parental consent**
    - **Follow-up**
    - **Gender**
    - **Birth asphyxia**
    - **Birth defect**
    - **Place of birth**
    - **Folic acid**
    - **Serious maternal illness**
    - **Radiation exposure**
    - **Substance abuse**
    - **Assisted conception**
    - **Anomalies in previous pregnancies**
    - **Birth defects**

    These features do not show a significant association with **Genetic Disorder** and might be less relevant in predicting the target variable.

**Numerical vs. Categorical Summary:**
Box plots, bar plots, and t-tests or ANOVA (for comparing means) are used to explore how a categorical variable impacts a numerical one.

- **Summary of the ANOVA results for the continuous features in relation to the `Genetic Disorder`:**
    - **Patient Age**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.76, \( p \)-value = 0.47
    - **Blood Cell Count**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.58, \( p \)-value = 0.56
    - **Mother Age**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.31, \( p \)-value = 0.73

    - **WBC Count**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.20, \( p \)-value = 0.82
      
    None of the continuous features (Patient Age, Blood Cell Count, Mother Age, Father Age, Previous Abortion Count, and WBC Count) show a statistically significant association with the `Genetic Disorder` based on the ANOVA results.
    
    All \( p \)-values are well above the conventional significance threshold of 0.05, indicating that these features **do not significantly influence** the presence or absence of the `Genetic Disorder`.

- **Summary of the ANOVA results for the continuous features in relation to the `Disorder Subclass`:**

    - **Patient Age**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.95, \( p \)-value = 0.47
    - **Blood Cell Count**: \( F \)-statistic = 1.10, \( p \)-value = 0.36
    - **Mother Age**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.35, \( p \)-value = 0.94
    - **Father Age**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.57, \( p \)-value = 0.80
    - **Previous Abortion Count**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.86, \( p \)-value = 0.55
    - **WBC Count**: \( F \)-statistic = 0.21, \( p \)-value = 0.99
    
    None of the continuous features (Patient Age, Blood Cell Count, Mother Age, Father Age, Previous Abortion Count, and WBC Count) show a statistically significant association with the `Disorder Subclass` based on the ANOVA results.
    
    All \( p \)-values are significantly higher than the conventional significance threshold of 0.05, indicating **no substantial relationship** between these features and the `Disorder Subclass`.


### Data Pre-processing

####  **Handling Missing Values**

Missing values can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models. We need to address them appropriately.

- **Numerical Columns**:
    - Binary Columns like `Symptom 1 - 5` and `Test 4`, we can fill Nan values with 0.
    - For columns like 'Patient Age', 'Blood cell count', 'Mother age', 'Father age', 'Previous abortion count', 'WBC count', we can fill missing values with the median of the column to avoid the influence of outliers.

- **Categorical Columns**: For columns like `Inherited from father`, `Maternal gene`, `Respiratory Rate`, `Heart Rate`, `Parental consent`, `Follow-up`, `Gender`, `Birth asphyxia`, `Birth defect`, `Place of birth`, `Folic acid`, `Serious maternal illness`, `Radiation exposure`, `Substance abuse`, `Assisted conception`, `Anomalies in previous pregnancies`, `Birth defects`, `Blood test result`, we can fill missing values with the mode of each column.

- **Target Columns**: First, the missing values in the `Genetic Disorder` column are filled based on the `Disorder Subclass`. After that, the missing values in the `Disorder Subclass` are filled with the mode for each `Genetic Disorder` category.

#### **Handling Outliers** ------------------------- pending



### Engineering Features
#### Encoding Categorical Variables and Scaling Numnerical Variables
Machine learning algorithms require numerical input. Hence, we need to convert categorical variables into numerical formats. Common techniques include:
- **Standard Scalar**: for numerical cols
- **Ordinal Encoding**: for categorical cols
- **Label Encoding**: for Target cols, two target variables will be predicted and evaluated separately:
    - Genetic Disorder
        - 'Mitochondrial genetic inheritance disorders': 0,
        - 'Multifactorial genetic inheritance disorders': 1,
        - 'Single-gene inheritance diseases': 2
    - Disorder Subclass
        - "Alzheimer's": 0,
        - 'Cancer': 1,
        - 'Cystic fibrosis': 2,
        - 'Diabetes': 3,
        - 'Hemochromatosis': 4,
        - "Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy": 5,
        - 'Leigh syndrome': 6,
        - 'Mitochondrial myopathy': 7,
        - 'Tay-Sachs': 8
