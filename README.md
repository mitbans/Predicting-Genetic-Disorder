#### CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) Framework
- Using CRISP-DM framework to predict genetic disorders and their subclasses.
- CRISP-DM consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

### Business Understanding

#### Objective:
Predict the genetic disorder and its subclass in children based on various medical and genetic attributes.

#### Goals:
- Develop a model to accurately classify the type of genetic disorder and its subclass.
- Provide insights to aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
