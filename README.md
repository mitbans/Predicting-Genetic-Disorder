# Predicting the Genetic Disorder
Capstone Project at UC Berkeley: PC-MLAI

## Context
As per reports, as a consequence of the unsustainable increase in population and a lack of access to adequate health care, food, and shelter, the number of genetic disorder ailments have increased. Hereditary illnesses are becoming more common due to a lack of understanding about the need for genetic testing. Often kids die as a result of these illnesses, thus genetic testing during pregnancy is critical.

## Business Understanding

#### Objective:
Predict the genetic disorder and its subclass in children based on various medical and genetic attributes.

#### Goals:
- Develop a model to accurately classify the type of genetic disorder and its subclass.
- Provide insights to aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Data Understanding

#### Overview:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains medical information about 22,083 children with genetic disorders with genetic disorders, aimed at predicting the type of genetic disorder and its subclass. There are 45 columns, each representing different attributes related to the patients' genetic, parental, and medical conditions, including 2 columns of target outputs - genetic disoder and its subclass.

#### Data Considerations
- **Missing Values:**
    - Several columns contain missing values, notably in maternal and paternal ages, certain medical tests, and specific genetic information.
    - It is crucial to address these missing values through imputation or other suitable methods to ensure robust model training.
- **Data Types:**
    - The dataset includes both numerical (float64) and categorical (object) data types.
    - Conversion and encoding of categorical variables will be necessary for machine learning model training.
- **Initial Observations:**
    - The dataset provides comprehensive medical and genetic information which can be leveraged to predict genetic disorders.
    - The presence of symptoms, medical test results, and parental genetic information are likely to be key predictors for the target variables.
    - Handling missing values, identifying outliers, data cleaning, data balancing and feature engineering are critical preprocessing steps to ensure the effectiveness of the predictive models.

#### Potential Challenges
- **Complex Interactions:** Genetic factors can interact with environmental and other factors in complex ways.
- **Data Privacy:** Handling sensitive patient data requires appropriate privacy measures. Remove such columns.
- **Interpretability:** Understanding the reasons behind model predictions can be challenging due to the complexity of genetic data. 

By thoroughly understanding and preparing the data, we can build accurate and reliable models to predict genetic disorders and their subclasses, ultimately aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation phase is crucial for ensuring that the dataset is clean, consistent, and suitable for model training. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and potentially feature engineering. Here are the detailed steps for data preparation:

### Data Cleaning:
- **Drop Irrelavent columns**
    - Remove columns that do not contribute to the prediction of genetic disorders, ensuring a more focused dataset.
    - Following columns are identified irrelavent: 'Patient Id', 'Patient First Name', 'Family Name', 'Father's name', 'Test 1', 'Test 2', 'Test 3', 'Test 5' (Test 1-3 and 5 have all values = 0)
- **Find and Remove Duplicates (if any)**: No Duplicates found.
- **Rename Columns**
  - Rename columns with appropriate short names for clarity and ease of use.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the Data Exploration phase, conducted a thorough analysis to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset. 
Key activities included:

#### **Missing Values Analysis:** 
Most columns have a missing rate of around 9-10%, with a few columns having more substantial gaps.
- **Low Missing Values (1% - 10%)**: *Inherited from father* (1.39%), *Patient Age* (6.46%).
- **Moderate Missing Values (9% - 10%)**: Many columns, such as *Respiratory Rate*, *Heart Rate*, *Parental Consent*, *Gender*, *Birth Asphyxia*, *WBC Count*, and *Genetic Disorder*, have around 9-10% missing data.
- **High Missing Values (Above 10%)**: *Maternal gene* (12.72%), *Birth Defect* (19.89%).
- **Very High Missing Values (Above 20%)**: *Mother's Age* (27.33%) and *Father's Age* (27.11%).    
    
#### **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Patient Age**: Average of 6.97 years, ranging from 0 to 14 years.
- **Blood Cell Count**: Average of 4.90 mcL, with values between 4.09 and 5.61 mcL.
- **Mother's Age**: Average of 34.53 years, ranging from 18 to 51 years.
- **Father's Age**: Average of 41.97 years, ranging from 20 to 64 years.
- **Test 4**: Uniform value of 1.0 across all records with ~10% missing values.

- **WBC Count**: Average of 7.49 (thousand per microliter), ranging from 3.0 to 12.0.
- **Symptoms 1-5**: Binary indicators (0 or 1) for the presence of symptoms.

#### **Distribution Analysis:**
Visualized the distributions of key variables using histograms, density plots and box plots to understand their spread and identify any skewness or kurtosis. This helped in detecting potential outliers and understanding the general data shape.

####  **Handling Missing Values**

Missing values can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models. We need to address them appropriately.

- **Numerical Columns**:
    - Binary Columns like `Symptom 1 - 5` and `Test 4`, we can fill Nan values with 0.
    - For columns like 'Patient Age', 'Blood cell count', 'Mother age', 'Father age', 'Previous abortion count', 'WBC count', we can fill missing values with the median of the column to avoid the influence of outliers.

- **Categorical Columns**: For columns like `Inherited from father`, `Maternal gene`, `Respiratory Rate`, `Heart Rate`, `Parental consent`, `Follow-up`, `Gender`, `Birth asphyxia`, `Birth defect`, `Place of birth`, `Folic acid`, `Serious maternal illness`, `Radiation exposure`, `Substance abuse`, `Assisted conception`, `Anomalies in previous pregnancies`, `Birth defects`, `Blood test result`, we can fill missing values with the mode of each column.

- **Target Columns**: First, the missing values in the `Genetic Disorder` column are filled based on the `Disorder Subclass`. After that, the missing values in the `Disorder Subclass` are filled with the mode for each `Genetic Disorder` category.
